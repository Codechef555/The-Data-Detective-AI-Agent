# The-Data-Detective-AI-Agent

This is an exciting opportunity! Based on your time constraint of 72 hours and the high standards of a Kaggle capstone project, 

I recommend an evolution of the project you attached, as it's a solid start.The current "Smart Recruiter AI Agent" is excellent, but we can make it more unique and impressive by shifting the focus to an extremely trendy and high-value domain: Software Development Automation or Data Analysis.Here is a proposal for a new, impressive project following the structure of the attached PDF, using a unique, 

in-demand topic:🌟 Proposed Capstone Project: Automated Data Analyst AI AgentThis project falls under the Enterprise Agents track, focusing on automating complex business intelligence workflows.📄 Project Writeup: Data Detective AI AgentProject OverviewAn intelligent, multi-agent system designed to perform end-to-end data analysis from a raw CSV/Excel file, generating an insights report, key visualizations, and suggesting actionable business recommendations.This AI agent empowers non-technical business users to derive deep, data-driven insights in minutes, eliminating the manual, time-consuming effort of traditional data analysis and reporting.☑ Problem StatementManual data analysis is a bottleneck in fast-moving enterprises:Time-Consuming: Data scientists spend hours on repetitive steps like data cleaning, transformation, and running basic descriptive statistics.Skill Barrier: Non-technical users cannot easily ask complex business questions to their data without an expert intermediary.Inconsistent Reporting: Human analysts may overlook subtle correlations or apply inconsistent reporting formats.Slow Decision Cycle: The delay between getting data and receiving actionable insights slows down business responsiveness.SolutionA multi-agent AI system featuring a coordinated workflow of specialized agents powered by Gemini, designed to act as an autonomous data analyst:Agent NameFunctionData Cleaner AgentIdentifies and fixes missing values, outliers, and converts data types for consistency.
